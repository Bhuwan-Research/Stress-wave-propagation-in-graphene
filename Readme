A small tutorial analyzes Stress Wave Propagation in a single-layer graphene sheet under fullerene projectile impact.
The AIREBO potential is used in molecular dynamics software (LAMMPS) for atomic interactions. The model consist of 20 nm x 20 nm graphene sheet,
fullerene projectile (C180).
The projectile was assigned a velocity of 3.6 km/s and hit in the middle of a fixed graphene sheet. 
The stress wave propagation in terms of planner stress is presented in the video.


Steps for simulations:
1. keep all the data files (C180.data, GSArm20x20.data) and script file in one folder.
2. Run the Lammps script file (SWP_graphene.lmp).
3. Open the trajectory file using VMD.
4. caluculate and plot the equvalent atomic planner stress using  Matlab.


This tutorial can be helpful to graduate students who are new to molecular dynamics.
